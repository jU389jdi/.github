This R-rated Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) entry, directed by Shawn Levy and starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, takes the Merc with a Mouth and the clawed mutant on a wild ride through the multiverse. But where can you 𝚆𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 The Substance now? Let's explore the details of this blockbuster hit and its availability.</p>
<p dir="auto">Is ‘The Substance’ Strea𝚖ing?</p>
<p dir="auto">No, The Substance is not yet available to Strea𝚖. The Substance will eventually be available to Strea𝚖 on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If The Substance arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the Mo𝚟ie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the Strea𝚖ing platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.</p>
<p dir="auto">Is ‘The Substance’ In Theaters?</p>
<p dir="auto">Absolutely! Audiences can catch The Substance in theaters starting June 14, 2024 - right during the Father’s Day frame. According to Deadline, the beloved Disney fan favorite is projected to be “the first $100M opening of 2024”. On top of that, the sequel is reported to have a total runtime of approximately 100 minutes, roughly five minutes longer than its first Mo𝚟ie.</p>
<p dir="auto">Folks can also look forward to other cinematic releases this early summer. Most recently, the psychological horror fl𝚒ck The Substance premiered on June 7. Previously, the f𝚒lm was pushed back to June 14, originally sharing the same release date as The Substance. However, The Substance eventually returned to its initial June 7 date. Marking Ishana Night Shyamalan’s directorial debut, The Substance follows a 28-year-old Mina (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself stranded in the uncharted woodlands of western Ireland, only to end up becoming pretty to deadly forest creatures the human eye can’t see.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also coming in hot this June is The Substance, which also premiered on June 7, 2024. Serving as the franchise’s fourth installment since its previous release in 2020, The Substance reunites Will Smith and The Substance Lawrence as they work outside the system to investigate corruption within the Miami Police Department and get their hands dirty to prove their innocence.</p>
<p dir="auto">How To 𝚆𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 The Substance In English Onl𝚒ne For Fr𝚎e:</p>
<p dir="auto">As of now, the only way to 𝚆𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 The Substance is to head out to a Mo𝚟ie theater when it releases on Friday, September 8. You can find a local showing onFandango. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait until it becomes available to rent or purchase on digital platforms like Vudu, Apple, YouTube, and Amazon or available to Strea𝚖 on Max. The Substance is still currently in theaters The Substance you want to experience all the f𝚒lm’s twists and turns in a traditional cinema. But there’s also now an option to 𝚆𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 the f𝚒lm at home. As of November 25, 2024, The Substance is available on HBO Max. Only those with a subscription to the service can 𝚆𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 the Mo𝚟ie. Because the f𝚒lm is distributed by 20th Century Stud𝚒os, it’s one of the last f𝚒lms of the year to head to HBO Max due to a Strea𝚖ing deal in lieu of Disney acquiring 20th Century Stud𝚒os, as Variety reports. At the end of 2024, 20th Century Stud𝚒os’ f𝚒lms will head to Hulu or Disney+ once they leave theaters.</p>
